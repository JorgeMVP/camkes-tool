# Marshall macros

These are a collection of macros intended to be used with the marshalling and
unmarshalling process of CAmkES RPC functional calls. The RPC-related CAmkES
connectors are built with the help of these macros and outside of the
connectors, there does not seem to be a use case for these macros.
